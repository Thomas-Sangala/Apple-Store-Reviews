# Apple-Store-Reviews

Problem Statement

As a data Analyst you will apply key statistical concepts to analyze a dataset of Apple Store product reviews. Your objective is to perform descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to draw meaningful insights from the data.

Perform the Following Statistical Analysis:

1.Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the app ratings in the dataset. Which measure (mean, median, or mode) best represents the central tendency of the ratings?
2.Find the range and interquartile range (IQR) of the Purchase_Amount in the dataset. How do these values help in understanding the spread of the data?
3.Calculate the variance and standard deviation for the number of likes received on reviews. What does the standard deviation indicate about the spread of the data?
4.Determine the correlation between the likes and the rating given. Is there a positive, negative, or no correlation between these variables?
5.Plot the distribution of the app ratings. Is the distribution positively or negatively skewed? What does this indicate about user satisfaction?
6.Perform a hypothesis test to determine if the average rating for Instagram is significantly higher than the average rating for WhatsApp. Use a 95% confidence level.
7.Take random samples of ratings from the dataset and calculate their means. Create a sampling distribution and explain how this relates to the Central Limit Theorem.
